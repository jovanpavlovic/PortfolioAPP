<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>For the past 10 years, I've been developing applications for the web using mostly PHP. I do this for a living and love what I do as every day there is something new and exciting to learn.</p>

<p>In my spare time, the web development community is a big part of my life. Whether teaching code to kids at a local school, managing online programming groups and blogs or attending a conference, I find keeping involved helps me stay up to date.</p>

<p>Besides programming I love spending time with friends and family and can often be found together going out catching the latest movie, staying in playing games on the sofa or planning a trip to someplace I've never been before.</p>

<p>I graduated from university Hull School of Art & Design where I studied web design and got a first class degree with honours. While I was at university I worked part time for a web design agency called Surrect Media that helped me to further hone in my skills as a developer. When not at work I'm usually working on a new project from home which could be anything to updating one of my sites to creating a new CRM application. Since leaving university I've been lucky enough to work for The One Point.</p>

<p>My job involves doing what I love, Developing new websites/applications, customer relationship management (CRM) applications and developing fantastic content management systems (CMS).</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time learning new techniques and actively help other people learn web development through a variety of help groups and writing web development tutorials for my website and blog about advancements in web design and development.</p>
